# 👋 Hi, I'm Víctor Orozco (tuxtor)

Welcome! I'm a passionate software developer and open source advocate from Guatemala, currently living in Brazil. With over 100 public repositories and a vibrant GitHub following, I thrive on building, sharing, and connecting.

## 🚀 What Drives Me
I'm fascinated by backend development, DevOps, and the power of cloud technologies. My curiosity leads me to explore frameworks, automation tools, and solutions that scale. I love turning ideas into projects that help others learn, grow, and solve real-world challenges.

## 🧑‍💻 Beyond Code
Mentorship, documentation, and public speaking are at the heart of my work. I regularly share insights through my [blog](https://www.vorozco.com) and on Twitter [@tuxtor](https://twitter.com/tuxtor), focusing on programming, cloud platforms, and open source culture.

## 🌍 Community First
I’m committed to empowering developers everywhere. By contributing code, improving docs, and supporting initiatives, I strive to foster innovation and inclusion. My journey is all about learning, sharing, and helping others succeed.
